Bearded guy from austria, loves to code, and digs deep into Code Quality, testing and general work improvement tools.

Beneath my job i am deeply bound to my social club organizing "open air cinemas", Christmasmarkets and all the other stuff, we think is fun, and people can benefit of. All of our events are tip based, so it is worth checking them out (www.togtrama.at)

Right now my mission is to successfully generate better version of me, first attempt looks great so far, second attempt is in progress :D
